# nfty.scripts

Sample configuration and some scripts for [ntfy.sh][ntfy], a self-hosted
notification service I'm trying out to give myself reminders. `etc/` and
`cache/` directories must be created separately for the docker image.

They have excellent [documentation][docs] and a CLI as well, so this was
more of an academic exercise for myself.

## Getting started

There are several ways to install ntfy, but I chose the docker route, so
a compose file is provided.
