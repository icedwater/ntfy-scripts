# ntfy server config file
#
# Please refer to the documentation at https://ntfy.sh/docs/config/ for details.
# All options also support underscores (_) instead of dashes (-) to comply with the YAML spec.

# Public facing base URL of the service (e.g. https://ntfy.sh or https://ntfy.example.com)
base-url: https://ntfy.mydomain.com

# If "cache-file" is set, messages are cached in a local SQLite database instead of only in-memory.
# This allows for service restarts without losing messages in support of the since= parameter.
#
# The "cache-duration" parameter defines the duration for which messages will be buffered
# before they are deleted. This is required to support the "since=..." and "poll=1" parameter.
# To disable the cache entirely (on-disk/in-memory), set "cache-duration" to 0.
# The cache file is created automatically, provided that the correct permissions are set.
#
# Check your permissions:
#   If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this cache file is owned by the
#   ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.

# If set, access to the ntfy server and API can be controlled on a granular level using
# the 'ntfy user' and 'ntfy access' commands. See the --help pages for details, or check the docs.
#
# - auth-file is the SQLite user/access database; it is created automatically if it doesn't already exist
# - auth-default-access defines the default/fallback access if no access control entry is found; it can be
#   set to "read-write" (default), "read-only", "write-only" or "deny-all".
#
auth-file: /var/lib/ntfy/user.db

# If set, the X-Forwarded-For header is used to determine the visitor IP address
# instead of the remote address of the connection.
#
# WARNING: If you are behind a proxy, you must set this, otherwise all visitors
#          are rate limited as if they are one.

# If enabled, clients can attach files to notifications as attachments. Minimum settings to enable attachments
# are "attachment-cache-dir" and "base-url".
#
# - attachment-cache-dir is the cache directory for attached files
# - attachment-total-size-limit is the limit of the on-disk attachment cache directory (total size)
# - attachment-file-size-limit is the per-file attachment size limit (e.g. 300k, 2M, 100M)
# - attachment-expiry-duration is the duration after which uploaded attachments will be deleted (e.g. 3h, 20h)
#

attachment-total-size-limit: "20M"
attachment-file-size-limit: "250K"
attachment-expiry-duration: "1h"

# Interval in which keepalive messages are sent to the client. This is to prevent
# intermediaries closing the connection for inactivity.
#
# Note that the Android app has a hardcoded timeout at 77s, so it should be less than that.
#
keepalive-interval: "60s"

# Interval in which the manager prunes old messages, deletes topics
# and prints the stats.
#
manager-interval: "10m"

# Defines the root path of the web app, or disables the web app entirely.
#
# Can be any simple path, e.g. "app" or "/", "home" or "/app", or "/ntfy". 
# Use "disable" or "" to disable the web app entirely.
#
web-root: "disable"

# Rate limiting: Total number of topics before the server rejects new topics.
#
global-topic-limit: 100

# Rate limiting: Number of subscriptions per visitor (IP address)
#
visitor-subscription-limit: 20

# Rate limiting: Allowed GET/PUT/POST requests per second, per visitor:
# - visitor-request-limit-burst is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has
# - visitor-request-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
# - visitor-request-limit-exempt-hosts is a comma-separated list of hostnames, IPs or CIDRs to be
#   exempt from request rate limiting. Hostnames are resolved at the time the server is started.
#   Example: "1.2.3.4,ntfy.example.com,8.7.6.0/24"
#
visitor-request-limit-burst: 20
visitor-request-limit-replenish: "5s"
visitor-request-limit-exempt-hosts: ""

# Rate limiting: Hard daily limit of messages per visitor and day. The limit is reset
# every day at midnight UTC. If the limit is not set (or set to zero), the request
# limit (see above) governs the upper limit.
#
visitor-message-daily-limit: 0

# Metrics
#
# ntfy can expose Prometheus-style metrics via a /metrics endpoint, or on a dedicated listen IP/port.
# Metrics may be considered sensitive information, so before you enable them, be sure you know what you are
# doing, and/or secure access to the endpoint in your reverse proxy.
#
enable-metrics: false

# Logging options
#
# By default, ntfy logs to the console (stderr), with an "info" log level, and in a human-readable text format.
#
# - log-format defines the output format, can be "text" (default) or "json"
# - log-file is a filename to write logs to. If this is not set, ntfy logs to stderr.
# - log-level defines the default log level, can be one of "trace", "debug", "info" (default), "warn" or "error".
#   Be aware that "debug" (and particularly "trace") can be VERY CHATTY. Only turn them on briefly for debugging purposes.
#
log-level: info
log-format: json
